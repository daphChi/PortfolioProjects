In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis to find answers to questions that will help any company to improve business and also offer great recommendations and insights.
## About The Project
***
A sales strategy known as "data-driven sales" involves gathering and analysing precise information for everything from lead product to loyal customer. Putting in place a data-driven sales strategy can help increase the profitability of your company. In this project, I analyze this sales data that is already available, use queries, functions and tools to get most prevalent KPIs such as where your sales are coming from, revenue by product, total Sales by time Period, revenue from customers, the number of customers lost to rivals, and Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth. Stores adopt a data-driven sales strategy and over time use such information to guide, advance, and empower their sales team.
