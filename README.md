# SalesDataProject
***
In this project, I explored a sales dataset and get numerous analytics and insights from customers previous purchasing patterns. Analysis of sales revenue is followed by the creation of a customer segmentation analysis..
## About The Project
***
A sales strategy known as "data-driven sales" involves gathering and analysing precise information for everything from lead product to loyal customer. Putting in place a data-driven sales strategy can help increase the profitability of your company. In this project, I analyzed this sales data that is already available, used queries, functions and tools to get most prevalent KPIs such as where your sales are coming from, revenue by product, total Sales by time Period, revenue from customers, the number of customers lost to rivals, and Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth. Stores adopt a data-driven sales strategy and over time use such information to guide, advance, and empower their sales team.
