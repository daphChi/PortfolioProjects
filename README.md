# SalesDataProject
***
In this project, I explored a sales dataset and get numerous analytics and insights from customers previous purchasing patterns. Analysis of sales revenue is followed by the creation of a customer segmentation analysis..
## About The Project
***
A sales strategy known as "data-driven sales" involves gathering and analysing precise information for everything from lead product to loyal customer. Putting in place a data-driven sales strategy can help increase the profitability of your company. In this project, I analyzed this sales data that is already available, used queries, functions and tools to get most prevalent KPIs such as where your sales are coming from, revenue by product, total Sales by time Period, revenue from customers, the number of customers lost to rivals, and Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth. Stores adopt a data-driven sales strategy and over time use such information to guide, advance, and empower their sales team.

***
+ Loyalist- Your best customers, who bought most recently,most often, and are heavy spenders.Reward these customers. They can become early adopters for new products and will help promote your brand.
+ Potential Loyalists- Your recent customers with average frequency and who spent a good amount. Offer membership or loyalty programs or recommend related products to upsell them and help them become your loyalists
+ Active/Regulars- Your recent customers with average frequency and who do not spend sizeable amounts. They already have a foundation of trust and so it is crucial to be polite and accommodating with them to satisfy their need to feel influential.
+ New Customers- Your recent customers with very low frequency.If they have a positive initial customer service experience, there is a tremendous potential to build brand loyalty and maybe win them over as the regulars then loyalists.
+ At-risk Customers- Your customers who purchased often and spent big amounts, but haven’t purchased recently. Send them personalized reactivation campaigns to reconnect, and offer renewals and helpful products to encourage another purchase.
+ Lost customers- Your customers who haven't purchase in recent times, and also had low frequency. Be reachable, show your appreciation and decide if you want to win them back, they’re likely not interested.
+ Lapsed customers- Your customers who have a high frequency but who haven’t come back to buy in an expected amount of time. Perhaps they buy where they get the best deals, send them special offers that include discount codes or limited time savings or introduce a loyalty program as a way to keep them engaged longer and reduce lapses.
+ Potential Churners- Customers who fail to become repeat customers.
